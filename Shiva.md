* Diamond Frost
    >Four baited personal puddles on light party, put these on inner waymarks, the puddles give slow when resolved that lasts until mid cast of the next Biting or Driving Frost
    >Shiva rings start on a cardinal that later becomes the safe spot and spread around the arena
    >Heavenly Strike: a Knock back 
    > * Use to move to the safe spot, stand on waymark to avoid earlier baited puddles.
    > * DPS without baits will get three dropped aoes on them and tank/healer without bait get a ga-100

* Light Rampant
    > Light party gets tethered together non baitable
    > * Each of the four players will get tethered to two of the three other players involved. 
    > * These players form a box around the the boss, and stand in meteor puddles. 
    > * Their Tethers should for an hour glass. If the the tethers initially for a square then the north two players (tank + healer) swap positions to fix this. 
    > * After their first Meteor resolves the players will move towards the only player they are not tethered to, and then rotate clockwise into a meteor puddle if necessery. 
    > * Finally After the second puddle is resolved the tether disappears and these players move into an inter - cardinal position at max melee
    > The other Light Party waits center and will be tethered to an orb on a cardinal positon
    > * These players move to the cardinal position clockwise of their orb, and wait at the edge of the arena. 
    > * As the orb gets close they slightly kite the orb until the second meteor puddle is resolves, at which point the their orb will shrink in size and can be taken by the player. 
    > * After the orb is eaten players remain at their cardinal and stand against the hitbox of Shiva to bait a cone. 
    > After both of these mechanics are resolve a final Meteor puddle under Shiva spawns, and requires four people. 
    > All players with three stacks of the light debuff take this final meteor and the mechanic is over. 
    > * Party Tether Players either start with a One stack or No stack Light debuff. Players with no debuff will end the mechanic with 3 stacks and take the last meteor
    > * Similarly Orb Tether players will either start with a Two stack or One stack Light debuff. Players from this group with One stack will end the mechanic with 3 stacks nad take the last meteor.

    > When resolving the Mirror hit all dps will get a stack marker. 
    > * This stack is either real or fake.

    > * If there isnt just stack.
