* Diamond Frost
    >Four baited personal puddles on light party, put these on inner waymarks, the puddles give slow when resolved that lasts until mid cast of the next Biting or Driving Frost.<br>
    >Shiva rings start on a cardinal that later becomes the safe spot and spread around the arena.<br>

    > * These players form a box around the the boss, and stand in meteor puddles. 
    > * Their Tethers should for an hour glass. If the the tethers initially for a square then the north two players (tank + healer) swap positions to fix this. 
    > * After their first Meteor resolves the players will move towards the only player they are not tethered to, and then rotate clockwise into a meteor puddle if necessery. 
    > * Finally After the second puddle is resolved the tether disappears and these players move into an inter - cardinal position at max melee. <br>
    > The other Light Party waits center and will be tethered to an orb on a cardinal positon.
    > * These players move to the cardinal position clockwise of their orb, and wait at the edge of the arena. 
    > * As the orb gets close they slightly kite the orb until the second meteor puddle is resolves, at which point the their orb will shrink in size and can be taken by the player. 
    > * After the orb is eaten players remain at their cardinal and stand against the hitbox of Shiva to bait a cone.  <br>
    > After both of these mechanics are resolve a final Meteor puddle under Shiva spawns, and requires four people. <br>
    > All players with three stacks of the light debuff take this final meteor and the mechanic is over. 
    > * Party Tether Players either start with a One stack or No stack Light debuff. Players with no debuff will end the mechanic with 3 stacks and take the last meteor.
    > * Similarly Orb Tether players will either start with a Two stack or One stack Light debuff. Players from this group with One stack will end the mechanic with 3 stacks nad take the last meteor. 
* Mirror, Mirror

    > Axe or Scythe Kick    
    > * If Axe kick get out then stack under the boss. 
    > * If Scythe get in then stand next to your mirror with partner. 
    > * Split into Pairs for this mechanic DPS & Healer/Tank. <br>
    > When resolving the Mirror hit all dps will get a stack marker. 
    > * This stack is either real or fake. 
    > * If there is a circle around the stack it is fake and will turn into a spread marker on all players. 
    > * If there isnt just stack. 
* Shattered World
    > Two big circles will be formed in the arena. Split into light parties and mitigate towards the end of the cast. These will be your parties for add phase. <br>

    > All three mirrors will be the same as the first cast. <br>
    > She will cast Hallowed Wings again, but it will be opposite of the first<br>
    > Players will walk into the quarter of the room safe from Shiva's cleave, and the mirrored cleave from the mirror with no cleave <br>

* Wyrm's Lament
    > All players receive a debuff, one light party gets a red debuff, and the other a blue <br> <br>

    > Red debuff 
    > * This debuff is used to trigger the dragon head floating around the arena
    > * The four debuffs will be staggered 
    > * 12s, 22s, 32s, 42s
    > * Players trigger their debuffs in order of timer

    > Blue debuff
    > * This debuff is very similar to the red debuff except instead of interacting with the dragon they pick up a puddle dropped by the red player when they resolve their buff. 
    > * Their buffs are also staggered
    > * 20s, 28s, 38s, 48s
    > * Players trigger their debuffs in order of the timer again

    >During this phase Shiva will constantly cast Hallowed Wings so players should trigger their buffs between casts.  <br> <br>

    > Continue this until all buffs are gone. 

* Redress into Shiva: the floor will turn to ice

* Twin Silence or Twin Stillness
    >Silence is Driving Frost into Biting Frost <br>
    >Stillness is Biting Frost into Driving Frost<br>
    >During this cast the floor will still be ice. Wait until the ice disappears and then adjust into the proper spot for whichever ability is casted

* Redress into Hraesvelgr: 
    >This will summon an Akh Rhai on each individual player <br>
    >Ideally you can stack all of them and move towards the end of the cast. 

* Mirror, Mirror
    >One red mirror, one green mirror <br>

    >Double Hallowed Wings
    >* Stand behind her to dodge her cast <br>
    
    >After first cast stack in front of the green mirror, the part will get hit. This functions like GCO. The first four people will receive a debuff and cannot take the red mirrors attack. So long as the group remains in the same line the mechanic will resolve itself. 

* Mirror, Mirror
    > Two no color, two green, two red

    > Redress into Oracle of Light
    > * This casts the gaze mechanic

    > All of the mirrors will copy the gaze mechanic
    > * Face the red mirror first, and then you can look at where the no color mirror was once it goes off until the mechanic resolves

    > Holy
    > * Summons an orb of light that will explode for proximity damage. Shiva can split this into cardinal's and intercardinals at the edge of the arena, stack center after the red mirror resolvesif they do, otherwise stay at the edge. 
    
    > Spiteful Dance/Embittered Dance
    > * Similar to Twin Silence/Twin Stillness this is the same thing but with Axe Kick/Scythe Kick
    > Spiteful Dance

    > Embittered Dance
    > * After cast she will immediately do Scythe Kick into a Axe Kick. 
    
* Mirror, Mirror
    > One Red Mirror <br>
    > Redress into Hraesvelgr <br>
    > The Mirror will copy Akh Rhai <br>
    > Stack and dodge the redress akh rhai stay stacked, and then dodge again at the mirror cast <br>
    > As the mirror cast resolves Shiva will cast an Akh Morn, so for the mirror dodge split into two groups for the Akh Morn.  <br>
    > Stack for a Morn Afah

* Icelit Dragonsong
    > This mechanic is similar to Light Rampant but with some mechanics replaced with mechanics from Diamond Frost. <br><br>

    > The meteors and tethers remain the same, but instead of wanting the tetehres to form an hour glass you actually want a square this time. 
    > * Healers take East and West.
    > * Tanks take North and South.
    > Both Tanks will have a debuff that will eventually freeze them like in Diamond Frost, but instead of esunaing them this time you'll let the debuff resolve. <br>
    > This is to allow the tanks to stay close to the center so the healers and get knocked back into the East and West Meteor Tower. <br><br>

    > Instead of Orbs The dps will get a personal bait AoE exactly like in Diamond frost and will drop them in the inter cardinal corners. <br><br>

    > After the bait puddles and meteors resolve Shiva will cast Draconic Strike. 
    > * This is the same as Heavenly Strike. 
    > * Dps will get knocked North and South based on the side they dropped their bait. After their bait puddles explode a second time they will run in the direction their puddle was placed. 
    > * Healers get knocked East and West into their meteor towers. 
    > Similar to the Light Rampant there will be players with only two stacks at the end of this bit and they will step into the center for the final meteor puddle. <br>

* House of Light
    > After the last puddle resolves players will spread into a protean position for this cone AoE on each player.

* Mirror, Mirror
    > One Red Mirror

* Redress into Shiva
    > Floor turns to ice, copied into mirror <br>
    > Move to edge of the arena in front of the mirror

* Redress into Hraesvelgr
    > Slide forward towards the center of the arena to avoid the Akh Rhai

* Wyrms Lament
    > This functions mostly the same as the first, but instead of Hallowed Wings this will be accompanied by Akh Morn into Morn Afah.  <br>
    > This time Reds will move after Akh Morn, and Blues will move after Morn Afah. <br>
    > Repeat this until all debuffs are resolved. 

* Mirror, Mirror (enrage)
    > Double Hallowed Wings, with 8 mirrors.
